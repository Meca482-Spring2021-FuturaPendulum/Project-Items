# **Introduction**

The Furuta Pendulum was invented in 1992 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta. It is composed of an arm which can rotate around a vertical axis to support an 
inverted pendulum that can rotate freely about a horizontal axis. The pendulum arm is attached to an encoder that reads the angle of the pendulum and creates a response that 
drives a motor to rotate an arm positioned 90¬∞ relative to the pendulum to keep it balanced upright. The project's goal is to create a control system algorithm in Matlab that can 
model this both linearly and nonlinearly in CoppeliaSim. An example of a Furuta/rotary pendulum manufactured by Quanser is shown below in Figure 1.

# **Modeling**

The system is underactuated since it employs only control input and consists of two degrees of freedom. Only one degree of freedom, the angular position of the rotary arm, ùú≠, is actively controlled. The angular position of the pendulum, ùú∂, is dependent upon the position of the rotary arm and the position of its own center of mass relative to the rotary arm. Table 1 below lists all parameters used in the calculations.

**Table 1.** Furuta Pendulum Parameters

The non-linear equations to represent the motion of the pendulum, Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), were derived from the representation that defines the pendulum‚Äôs motion shown in Figure 2.

![eq 1 eq 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276696-61015100-bbd0-11eb-9c57-1db25746f288.png)

Eq.(1) and Eq.(2) were linearized to develop a state-space model for the pendulum. The state-space equations are defined in Eq.(3) and Eq.(4).

![eq 3 eq 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276749-afaeeb00-bbd0-11eb-8b05-4f82e3e8e89a.png)

In these equations, x represents the state, y represents the output, and u represents the control input. The state and output for the Furuta pendulum are defined in Eq.(5) and Eq.(6).

![eq 5 eq 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276790-e422a700-bbd0-11eb-8e15-1392640b17b1.png)

To linearize Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), it is assumed that all initial conditions for all the variables, 0, 0, 0,and 0, are zero. With these conditions, Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) are derived.

![eq 7 eq 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276816-0b797400-bbd1-11eb-998f-890dc13b3e73.png)

Using Eq.(7) and Eq.(8), the following matrix,Eq.(9) is created where the determinant of the 2x2 matrix is shown in Eq.(10.1) with Eq.(10.2) being its simplification. 

![eq 9 eq 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276837-28ae4280-bbd1-11eb-9f8b-cc0399337ea7.png)

Next, the angular acceleration of the pendulum and rotary arm are solved for in Eq.(11).

![eq 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276849-349a0480-bbd1-11eb-8bf3-24dbe5fdc262.png)

From Eq.(11), the first row of the matrix equates to Eq.(12.1), simplified in Eq.(12.2), while the second is described in Eq.(13.1) and simplified in Eq.(13.2).

![eq 12 eq 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276877-5a270e00-bbd1-11eb-83c3-04c572ab4f45.png)

From Eq.(5),  x1= x3,  x2=x4where x can be substituted for each variable: , ,  ,and  . From these the matrices A and B can be found. In Eq.(14) and Eq.(15)  x3and  x4are described.

![eq 14 eq 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276911-86428f00-bbd1-11eb-9710-dbecc135b3e6.png)

From these equations A and B can be described from Eq.(3) below where Eq.(16) represents the A matrix and Eq.(17) represents the B matrix.
