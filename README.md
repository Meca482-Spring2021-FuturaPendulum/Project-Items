# **Introduction**

The Furuta Pendulum was invented in 1992 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta. It is composed of an arm which can rotate around a vertical axis to support an 
inverted pendulum that can rotate freely about a horizontal axis. The pendulum arm is attached to an encoder that reads the angle of the pendulum and creates a response that 
drives a motor to rotate an arm positioned 90¬∞ relative to the pendulum to keep it balanced upright. The project's goal is to create a control system algorithm in Matlab that can 
model this both linearly and nonlinearly in CoppeliaSim. An example of a Furuta/rotary pendulum manufactured by Quanser is shown below in Figure 1.

# **Modeling**

The system is underactuated since it employs only control input and consists of two degrees of freedom. Only one degree of freedom, the angular position of the rotary arm, ùú≠, is actively controlled. The angular position of the pendulum, ùú∂, is dependent upon the position of the rotary arm and the position of its own center of mass relative to the rotary arm. Table 1 below lists all parameters used in the calculations.

   **Table 1.** Furuta Pendulum Parameters.

The non-linear equations to represent the motion of the pendulum, Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), were derived from the representation that defines the pendulum‚Äôs motion shown in Figure 2.

</p>

Eq.(1) and Eq.(2) were linearized to develop a state-space model for the pendulum. The state-space equations are defined in Eq.(3) and Eq.(4).

   ![eq 3 eq 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276749-afaeeb00-bbd0-11eb-8b05-4f82e3e8e89a.png)
</p>

In these equations, x represents the state, y represents the output, and u represents the control input. The state and output for the Furuta pendulum are defined in Eq.(5) and Eq.(6).

   ![eq 5 eq 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276790-e422a700-bbd0-11eb-8e15-1392640b17b1.png)
</p>

To linearize Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), it is assumed that all initial conditions for all the variables, 0, 0, 0,and 0, are zero. With these conditions, Eq.(7) and Eq.(8) are derived.


<p align = "center"
   
   ![eq 7 eq 8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276816-0b797400-bbd1-11eb-998f-890dc13b3e73.png)
</p>

Using Eq.(7) and Eq.(8), the following matrix,Eq.(9) is created where the determinant of the 2x2 matrix is shown in Eq.(10.1) with Eq.(10.2) being its simplification. 


<p align = "center"
   
   ![eq 9 eq 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276837-28ae4280-bbd1-11eb-9f8b-cc0399337ea7.png)
</p>

Next, the angular acceleration of the pendulum and rotary arm are solved for in Eq.(11).

   ![eq 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276849-349a0480-bbd1-11eb-8bf3-24dbe5fdc262.png)
</p>

From Eq.(11), the first row of the matrix equates to Eq.(12.1), simplified in Eq.(12.2), while the second is described in Eq.(13.1) and simplified in Eq.(13.2).


<p align = "center"
   
   ![eq 12 eq 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84546893/119276877-5a270e00-bbd1-11eb-83c3-04c572ab4f45.png)
</p>

From Eq.(5),  x1'= x3,  x2'=x4 where x can be substituted for each variable: ùú≠, ùú∂, ùú≠', and ùú∂'. From these the matrices A and B can be found. In Eq.(14) and Eq.(15) x3' and  x4' are described.


<p align = "center"

</p>

From these equations A and B can be described from Eq.(3) below where Eq.(16) represents the A matrix and Eq.(17) represents the B matrix.

# Calibration
There is no hardware available for the system, therefore calibration is not needed.

# Controller Design and Simulation
In this section we will discuss the Simulink controller we attempted to implement into our simulation design. We have a simulink model for the swing up motion of the pendulum, Figure 4, that also incorporates the balance control of the pendulum, Figure 3, once it is upright. Within the swing up block diagram, we had made extensive additions to the subsystems within the block diagram which we are also including down below which are shown in Figure 5 through Figure 7.

Within the Pendulum Swing up diagram, there were multiple subsystems that needed to be addressed. Figure 5 shows the Swing up subsystem.

Along with the Simulink block diagrams we implemented in our project, we also were able to develop the simulated closed loop balance control response for the voltage, alpha, and theta variables. These are graphed in Figure 8 through Figure 10.

Using MATLab, the team was able to create three more graphs to show the output torque, pole zero map, and root locus plot of the system. Each of these graphs can be seen in Figure 11 through Figure 13.

Lastly, we have our designed model of the Furuta Pendulum in CoppeliaSim, shown in Figure 14. We utilized 3 cylinders which served to be the stand, the rotary arm as well as the pendulum. We also incorporated 2 revolute joints which provided the proper pivots to allow the rotary arm to swivel, and the pendulum to swing from the rotary arm.
