# Furuta Pendulum
Rotary inverted pendulum framework created for MECA 482, Control System Design, at CSU Chico

**Introduction**
The Furuta Pendulum was invented in 1992 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta. It is composed of an arm which can rotate around a vertical axis to support an 
inverted pendulum that can rotate freely about a horizontal axis. The pendulum arm is attached to an encoder that reads the angle of the pendulum and creates a response that 
drives a motor to rotate an arm positioned 90Â° relative to the pendulum to keep it balanced upright. The project's goal is to create a control system algorithm in Matlab that can 
model this both linearly and nonlinearly in CoppeliaSim. An example of a Furuta/rotary pendulum manufactured by Quanser is shown below in Figure 1.
